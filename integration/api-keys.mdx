## Overview

API keys are the primary method for authenticating requests to the Mintie Calendar Public API. This guide covers everything you need to know about creating, managing, and securing your API keys.

## Creating API Keys

You can create API keys through the API by providing a descriptive name, permission scopes, and an optional expiration date. When you create a key, you'll receive the full API key value only once—make sure to store it securely immediately.

<Warning>
  API keys are only shown once during creation. Store them in a secure location immediately!
</Warning>

## Listing API Keys

You can view all API keys for your account, including their names, prefixes, scopes, creation dates, expiration dates, and last usage timestamps. For security, the full API key is never returned after creation—only the prefix is shown.

<Note>
  For security, the full API key is never returned after creation. Only the prefix is shown.
</Note>

## Getting Key Details

You can retrieve detailed information about a specific API key, including when it was last used, its current expiration status, assigned scopes, and creation date. This is useful for monitoring key usage and ensuring proper access control.

## Revoking API Keys

You can revoke API keys that are no longer needed or may be compromised. Revocation is immediate and irreversible—any applications using that key will lose access instantly.

<Warning>
  Revoking a key is immediate and irreversible. Any applications using that key will lose access instantly.

## API Key Scopes

### Permission Levels

  <Card title="WRITE" icon="pen">
    Create, update, and delete resources
  </Card>
  <Card title="ADMIN" icon="crown">

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Scope Matrix

| Action | READ | WRITE | ADMIN |
|--------|------|-------|-------|
| View account info | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Get analytics | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| List webhooks | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Create webhooks | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Update webhooks | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Delete webhooks | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| List API keys | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Create API keys | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Revoke API keys | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |

### Choosing the Right Scopes

- **Analytics Dashboard**: Use `read` scope for read-only access to view metrics and usage data
- **Webhook Integration**: Use `read` and `write` scopes to create and manage webhook subscriptions
- **Admin Tool**: Use `read`, `write`, and `admin` scopes for full access including key management
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Use `write` scope for automated deployments without admin privileges

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use Descriptive Names">
    Include the purpose and environment in key names:

    ✅ Good: "Production Mobile App", "Staging Analytics", "Dev Environment"

    ❌ Bad: "Key 1", "Test", "My Key"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Set Expiration Dates">
    Use expiration dates for temporary or short-term keys. For example, set a 90-day expiration for project-specific keys or 24-hour expiration for demo access.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Rotate Keys Regularly">
    Implement a key rotation schedule:

    1. Create a new API key
    2. Update applications to use the new key
    3. Monitor the old key's `last_used_at`
    4. Revoke the old key after confirming no usage

    **Recommended rotation frequency**: Every 90 days for production keys
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Minimal Scopes">
    Grant only the permissions needed. For example, analytics services should only have `read` access, while admin dashboards need full `read`, `write`, and `admin` scopes.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Monitor Key Usage">
    Regularly check `last_used_at` timestamps to identify unused or stale keys. Consider revoking keys that haven't been used in 30+ days.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Revoke Compromised Keys Immediately">
    If a key is exposed:

    1. **Immediately revoke the compromised key**
    2. Create a new key with the same permissions
    3. Update all applications using the old key
    4. Review access logs for suspicious activity
    5. Consider revoking all keys and rotating
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Key Lifecycle Management

<Steps>
  <Step title="Creation">
    Generate a new API key with appropriate scopes and expiration
  </Step>

  <Step title="Deployment">
    Store the key securely (environment variables, secrets manager)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Monitoring">
    Track key usage via `last_used_at` timestamp
  </Step>

  <Step title="Rotation">
    Create replacement keys before expiration
  </Step>

  <Step title="Revocation">
    Delete old or compromised keys
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Common Patterns

### Environment-Based Keys

Use different API keys for development, staging, and production environments. Store them as environment variables and load them based on your current environment.

### Service-Specific Keys

Create dedicated keys for each service or application (mobile app, web dashboard, analytics engine, admin panel) with appropriate scopes for each use case.

### Temporary Access Keys

For demos or short-term access, create keys with expiration dates (e.g., 24 hours for demo access, 90 days for project-specific integrations).

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="401 Unauthorized Error">
    **Problem**: API returns "Invalid API key"

    **Solutions**:
    - Verify the key is correctly copied (no extra spaces)
    - Check if the key has expired
    - Confirm the key hasn't been revoked
    - Ensure you're using Bearer token format
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="403 Forbidden Error">
    **Problem**: "Insufficient permissions" error

    **Solution**: Create a new key with required scopes or use an admin key
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Lost API Key">
    **Problem**: API key was not saved after creation

    **Solution**: You cannot retrieve the full key. Create a new one and revoke the lost key:

    ```bash
    # Create new key
    curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/public/v1/api-keys" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{"name": "Replacement Key", "scopes": ["read", "write"]}'

    # Revoke lost key (if you know the ID)
    curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:8000/public/v1/api-keys/key_lost123"
    ```
  </Accordion>
